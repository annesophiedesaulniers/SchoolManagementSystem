# SchoolManagementSystem
This is a school management system where we have a student class, a teacher class, a department class and a course class. Each department, student, teacher and course has an id. We are able to add new students, teachers, courses and departments and we are able to display them if they are not null. There is a maximum of 5 different departments, 200 students, 20 trachers and 30 different courses. Each course is taught by a teacher and has a maximum of 5 students attending. So we can assign a course to a teacher and we can register a course for a student. A student can register in maximum 5 different courses. We are also able to search for a student, teacher, course or department based on its id. We are able to add new student, teachers, departments and courses. However, in the scool there is a max of 200 students, 5 departments, 20 teachers and 30 courses. Each of them are identified with a different id. We are able to display them if they are not null. Each course is taught by a teacher which can be modified and has a maximum of 5 students registered in it. So, we can assign to a teacher a course and we can register a student to a course. A student is allowed to register in a max of 5 different courses. So the student cannot register in the same course twice. We are also able to search for a student, teacher, course or department based on its id.
