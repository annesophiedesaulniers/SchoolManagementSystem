# SchoolManagementSystem
This is a school management system where we have a student class, a teacher class, a department class and a course class. Each department, student, teacher and course has an id. We are able to add new students, teachers, courses and departments and we are able to display them if they are not null. There is a maximum of 5 different departments, 200 students, 20 trachers and 30 different courses. Each course is taught by a teacher and has a maximum of 5 students attending. So we can assign a course to a teacher and we can register a course for a student. A student can register in maximum 5 different courses. We are also able to search for a student, teacher, course or department based on its id.
